# Export-Led-Growth-Hypothesis
Working Paper done as Internal Assignment for Indian Economy 6, taught by Dr. Aasheerwaad Dwivedi 

In this article, we reviewed the theoretical relationship between Indian exports, real broad effective exchange rate, and world demand. Time series data vectors for the three
variables were checked for stationarity. We then proceeded to construct a model explaining the export function and run an OLS regression. We use cointegration tests 
to see if there are any long-term cointegrating equations between the variables. We can see that the data from 1996 to 2015 shows no evidence of the presence of any long-term cointegration equations. After running the necessary regression, we see a substantial link between global demand and export share, with the real effective exchange rate playing a minor role. Also, the results were shown to be robust to a variety of possible sources of specification error.

Our analysis is partly in tandem with the macroeconomic model designed by Mundell and Fleming which is suggestive of exports being driven by global GDP. Research also
tells us that there is a strong relationship between exports and world demand. This has been attested in the Indian context earlier on. In support of previous literature, Indian exports do not respond to price changes, and India's export performance is not generally influenced by exchange rate fluctuations. Additionally, It has been noticed that
capital flows, rather than traditional trade flows, have a greater impact on exchange rates. However, there is theoretical ambiguity when it comes to real effective exchange
rates and exports as other studies are of the view that the exchange rate is an imperative component to determine the export function of a country and India portrays a negative relation between the two.
